Structures : are user defined value types 
        - are meant to group other related variables as one unit
        - are similar to C# classes except that they cannot participate in inheritance etc.

Enum : is a set of named constants
 - is a user defined value type
 - default type of enumeration list elements is init

Strings : Are collections of Characters
- Memory is allocated on the heap
- Is a predefined Reference type
- strings are immutable
- has fixed size

String builders : are mutable strings

Arrays : is a collection of values of same datatype
       - has a fixed size
       - are operated using the index or subscript value

Types of Arrays : 
   -Single dimension
   -Two/multidimension
   -Jagged :
       - are often called array of arrays
       - an element of a jagged array itself is an array
      
int[][] jarray = new int[3][]
jarray[0]=new int[]{1,2,3,4}
jarray[1]=new int[]{5,6,7}
jarray[2]=new int[]{8,9}


OO Programming :

-- is a software development methodology that is based on modelling a real-world system

Characteristics of Object Orientation :
  1. Realistic Model
  2. Reusability
  3. Resilience to change
  4. Existence in different forms

Consists of classes and objects
 car as a class
   - state
   - behaviour
   - message

JAM :
  A cell Phone : off, ring, vibrate, call
  A Stereo : play, off, pause, rewind, forward

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

A class is type that defines the various elements of program that we may want to have 
An object is the constructed class, which is usable 
(an object is an instance of the class)

Object is a root of all types
  - GetType
  - GetHashCode
  - Equals
  - ReferenceEquals
  - ToString

Constructors : Default constructor is provided by the framework/system, when we do not have our constructors

- Are Special Functions of a class
- To initialize the fields
- They have the same name as that of the class
- They do not have any return types
- They can be parameterized
- They may be overloaded
- They have to be either internal or public only

Access Specifiers :
1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Internal
5. Protected Internal or Internal Protected

int[] a = new int[5];
int[] a = new int[5]{1,2,3,4,5}
int[] a = new int[]={10,20,30,40,50};
