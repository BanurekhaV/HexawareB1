Structures : are user defined value types 
        - are meant to group other related variables as one unit
        - are similar to C# classes except that they cannot participate in inheritance etc.

Enum : is a set of named constants
 - is a user defined value type
 - default type of enumeration list elements is init

Strings : Are collections of Characters
- Memory is allocated on the heap
- Is a predefined Reference type
- strings are immutable
- has fixed size

String builders : are mutable strings

Arrays : is a collection of values of same datatype
       - has a fixed size
       - are operated using the index or subscript value

Types of Arrays : 
   -Single dimension
   -Two/multidimension
   -Jagged :
       - are often called array of arrays
       - an element of a jagged array itself is an array
      
int[][] jarray = new int[3][]
jarray[0]=new int[]{1,2,3,4}
jarray[1]=new int[]{5,6,7}
jarray[2]=new int[]{8,9}


OO Programming :

-- is a software development methodology that is based on modelling a real-world system

Characteristics of Object Orientation :
  1. Realistic Model
  2. Reusability
  3. Resilience to change
  4. Existence in different forms

Consists of classes and objects
 car as a class
   - state
   - behaviour
   - message

JAM :
  A cell Phone : off, ring, vibrate, call
  A Stereo : play, off, pause, rewind, forward


int[] a = new int[5];
int[] a = new int[5]{1,2,3,4,5}
int[] a = new int[]={10,20,30,40,50};
