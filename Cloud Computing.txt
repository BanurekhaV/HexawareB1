Cloud Computing : is an internet based computing services in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data storage, and online access to computer services, resources 

- Users can provision and release resources on-demand
- Resources can be scaled up or scaled down, automatically on the load
- Allows pay as you go

Service Models:

IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service
PAAS - Platform as a service
SAAS - Software as a service
CAAS - Container as a service
FAAS - Function as a service or 
       Serverless computing

Deployment Model :

Private Cloud
Hybrid Cloud
Public Cloud


Cloud Providers : AWS, Azure, GCP, etc...

"Application power and run the business"
 - Design and Development of an application
 - Hosting the application on to a server
     For which we procure a physical server
       - Server Cost
       - Energy Cost
       - Maintenance Cost
       - OS Cost
       - WorkForce ( operations and security)


Vitualization : 

VMs virtualizes the hardware
  Many Guest OS are installed, and hence licence cost
  Admin time for both Host and Guset Os
  VM OS bootup consumes time

Containers Virtualizes the OS
   Admin time just for one OS
   Only one Host OS cost
   Speed


Reduced Cost ( both capex and opex) 
Scalability
Business Continuity
Availability
Automatic Updates

Loss of cloud Data :
Data Security :
Cost Concern : 


On Premise Data center :
  1. procuring Physical servers
  2. Install and set up
  3. Setting Server Room 
  4. Ensure Main power supply, back-up power, cooling system are in place
  5. Install and configure virtualization software
