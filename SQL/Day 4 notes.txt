Subqueries : Are query within a query 
--inner query 
--main query

Guidelines for using subqueries
1. Enclose the inner Query/subquery in parenthesis
2. Place the subqueries on the right hand side of the comparison condition
3. Use Single-row operators with single-row subquery and multi-row operators with multi-row subqueries

 
Single-Row sub queries : queries that return only one value
 Operators : >, <, >=,<=,<>,=

Multi Row sub queries : queries that return more than 1 value
 operators : in, any, all ( these operators can be used along with single row operators
                             eg : >all , =any, >any, <any)
