Checked and Unchecked Exceptions

goto label: Are unstructured way of controlling flow of statements.
            They transfer control within the function
            They are used with valid identifiers followed by a ':'

Extension Methods : are new methods that are added to an existing class without editing the source. The new methods also will be accessible using the existing class object itself


Assignment : if we want to add a new function to count the number of words in a string, then we do not have any method for it in the string class. Also we do not have the string class source code.  


Indexers : An indexer is one that allows an instance of a class or structure to be indexed as an array
           Behaves like an virtual array
           [] - array accessor to access
           Are like properties, but have accessors with parameters
           Can be overloaded
           Indexers are always referred using a this, unlike the properties which have names

Collections : In C# are special classes for data storage, retrieval, manipulations etc..
              size is dynamic
              data types for some collections can be different

common collection classes: ArrayList, SortedList, Stacks, Queues, HashTables etc

    sortedlist, queue

Generics : allows to create generic classes, methods, properties, fields decoupled with data types
           it is a way to define type safe classes without compromising
                      - performance
                      - type safety   
                      - productivity

they are defined using a template <T>

  NonGeneric                         Generic
   AraryList   ------->              List
   HashTable   ------->              Dictionary
   

Tuples : are data structures that contains a sequence of elements of different data types. It can be used when we want to store the properties of an object without having to create a separate type

They are very useful if we want to return more than one value from a method

The other ways with which we can return multiple values are :
 1. Using Custom Datatype : Returning a class object with multiple values
 2. Using Out keywords  : is difficult to understand the working and also does not support asynchronous calls
 3. Using Dynamic keyword :  Has performance overheads and so we may not want to use it
