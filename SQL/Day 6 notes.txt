Normalization :

Is a process of decomposing a larger, complex table into several smaller ones
- We move from lower normal forms to higher

-Normal Forms 
  1NF 
  2NF
  3NF
  BCNF
  4NF
  5NF

Why ?
Redundancy - is the root of several problems associated with relational schemas
- Redundancy leads to several anomalies(insert, update, delete)
- Wastage of storage space

hence Normalizing table structures become mandatory
--The technique used to normalize tables is Functional Dependency

Functional Dependency : Describes the relationship between attributes in a relation.

1st Normal Form : states that every row in a table should contain exactly one value for each attribute
-- Disallow multivalued attribute, composite attributes and their combinations

2nd Normal Form : states that a relation should already be in 1NF
 - Every Non-prime attribute in the Given R(relation) should be fully functionally dependent on the prime attribute (whole key/composite)
 - 2nf prohibits partial dependencies

3rd Normal Form : states that the table is already in 2NF, and no non-prime attribute of a relation is indirectly or transitively dependent on the primary key
  - 3nf prohibits transitive dependencies


File groups in sql server:
--Database Files
 --.mdf  Primary Group , .ndf - secondary group , .ldf - log files

 dbcc showfilestats

 create database FileDB on Primary
 (
 Name='FileDB',
 FileName='C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\fDB.mdf',
 size=5mb,
 maxsize=unlimited,

--SQL and NO Sql

SQL : Structured data handling
      Is designed to handle standard programing lang to manage and manipulate data
      It allows to CRUD of data stored in tables - a well structured and well defined format
      Vertically scalable(upgrading hardware)
      ACID compliance
      SQL as a Lang
      Efficient for complex queries, transactions etc
      Usage : Transactional Systems viz. Banking, Ecommerce, ERP
      SqlServer, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL etc

NoSQL : Unstructured data handling
        Is designed to handle large volumes of data, which may have different formats and not any fixed format
                 (eg. Key value pair, documents, graphs)
        Horizontally scalable (add more servers)
        BASE Compliance 
        Depends on the database
        Efficient for large scale data reading/writing
        Usage : Bigdata, complex web applications
        MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis etc.
        
Eg : 

Products=[
{"id" : 101, "Pname" :"Pens","price" : 20},
{"id":                                     ]
