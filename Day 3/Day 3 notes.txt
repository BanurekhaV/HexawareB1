Binary Search Tree : basic operations like
   - Search
   - Insert
   - Pre order Traversal
   - In-Order "
   - Post-Order "

AVL Trees : are defined as height balanced binary search tree, in which each node is associated with a balance factor. Balance factor is calculated by subtracting the height of its right subtree from its left subtree.

- Balanced tree is one where the balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1

 -Balance Factor (k) = height(left(k)) - height(right(k))
- We perform rotation in AVL trees if the balance factor is not either -1, 0,1
- There are basically 4 types of rotations 
   1. LL : inserted node is in the left subtree of left subtree of A
   2. RR : inserted node is in the right subtree of the right subtree of A
   3. LR : inserted node is in the right subtree of the left subtree of A
   4. RL : inserted node is in the left subtree of the Right subtree of A
