Subqueries : Are query within a query 
--inner query 
--main query

Guidelines for using subqueries
1. Enclose the inner Query/subquery in parenthesis
2. Place the subqueries on the right hand side of the comparison condition
3. Use Single-row operators with single-row subquery and multi-row operators with multi-row subqueries

 
Single-Row sub queries : queries that return only one value
 Operators : >, <, >=,<=,<>,=

Multi Row sub queries : queries that return more than 1 value
 operators : in, any, all ( these operators can be used along with single row operators
                             eg : >all , =any, >any, <any)

1. in: Works like an or clause 
2. any : compares value to each value returned by the subquery. Picks rows, if any one matches with the list (inner query)
3. and : compares value to each value returned by the subquery. Picks only those rows that matches with all the values in the list(inner query)

--We can include group by and having clauses in the sub query and not order by. Order by can be used only in the main query

--exists/not exists operator : Test for existence of rows in the subquery. 
 - If found, search stops and the inner query returns true.
 - If not found, then inner query returns false and continues to search the remaining rows
 - Equivalent to 'in' and 'not in' operators
 - 'in' and 'not in' involves data retrieval, but exists/non exists does not
